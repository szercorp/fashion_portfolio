      Fashion and art have always been two major pylons in my life that enabled
      me to express my views and beliefs through creativity channels.
      Constructions with innovative materials that distort the garment's
      textures act as a communication code for me to transfer messages that
      reflect my point of view on important issues of the society. I focused on
      the functionality of clothes with a creative outlook that would give them
      a distinctive trait. One of the most invaluable experiences that act as my
      guide in terms of creation and inspiration was the charity trips. People
      coming from differently structured societies and cultures are a great form
      of inspiration that I seek to express through my designs.
